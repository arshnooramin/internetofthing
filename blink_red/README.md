# RMT LED Strip Blink

This is an example project based on the [RMT LED Strip project](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/examples/peripherals/rmt/led_strip/). The original project functions to blink the built-in LED at a high frequency and cycles through different colors. This modified project simplifies it so that the program now blinks the LED red with a longer delay.

The purpose of modifying the original example project was to understand the development cycle within the ESP-IDF framework and the different files that are required for a ESP-IDF project/program to successfully compile and function. Given below is a breakdown of the ESP-IDF project structure.
